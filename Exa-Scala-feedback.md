# Project: ScalaData

## CAVEATS
So I don't repeat the same thing over and over with each point below, let me say up front that I know you write this as a way to actually use what you have learned reading up on Scala so you took shortcuts you wouldn't otherwise. I am going to point out these shortcuts that I do not like as for me, I would have to consciously force myself to take those shortcuts and likely would never do so as I treat all my code as something I would want to put in production and that way I don't have to think about not taking shortcuts, etc.
