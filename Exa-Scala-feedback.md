# Project: ScalaData

## CAVEATS
So I don't repeat the same thing over and over with each point below, let me say up front that I know you write this as a way to actually use what you have learned reading up on Scala so you took shortcuts you wouldn't otherwise. I am going to point out these shortcuts that I do not like as for me, I would have to consciously force myself to take those shortcuts and likely would never do so as I treat all my code as something I would want to put in production and that way I don't have to think about not taking shortcuts, etc.  

## General
1. `gitignore` - You had a gitignore but only under the .idea folder. Best to put one at the root and to make your life easier, go to gitignore.io to generate the base that you can then add to with your specific project structure. 
1. `semi-colons` - You only need to use semi-colons if you have multiple statements on the same line.
